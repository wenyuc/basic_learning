    "### Difference Between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outcome\n",
    "\n",
    "In linear regression, the outcome (dependent variable) is continuous. It can have any one of an infinite number of possible values.\n",
    "\n",
    "In logistic regression, the outcome (dependent variable) has only a limited number of possible values. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The dependent variable\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is used when the response variable is categorical in nature. For instance, yes/no, true/false, red/green/blue, 1st/2nd/3rd/4th, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression is used when your response variable is continuous. For instance, weight, height, number of hours, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Equation\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear regression gives an equation which is of the form Y = mX + C, means equation with degree 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, logistic regression gives an equation which is of the form $ Y = \\cfrac{1}{1+ e^{-x}}$"
