    "### Chebyshev's Theorem\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview\n",
    "Chebyshev's theorem gives you the minimum proportion of data that is within K standard deviations of the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to calculate the proportion, you could use the formula:\n",
    "$$ 1- \\cfrac{1}{k^2} \\;,\\; k> 1$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Chebyshev's theorem works for any type of distrbution. It's an inequality. It gives you the minimum amount of a portion or the minimum fortune of data that is within standard deviation of the mean. \n",
    "\n",
    "It doesnt give you the exact answer but it gives you a range of answers. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The average weight of individuals in city XYZ is 170lbs with a standard deviation of 10. \n",
    "\n",
    "**(a)** If the city contains 200,000 residents, what is the minimum percentage of individuals with a weight between 145lbs and 195lbs in the city?\n",
    "\n",
    "$ x= \\mu + k|cdot{s} $\n",
    "\n",
    "$ k = \\cfrac{x-\\mu}{s} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, $ k=2.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "plugs into $ 1-\\cfrac{1}{k^2} \\approx 0.84$\n",
    "\n",
    "**(b)** what is the minimum **amount** of individuals with weight between 140lbs and 200lbs?\n",
    "\n",
    "$ k = \\cfrac{x-\\mu}{s} $\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, $ k=3$\n",
    "\n",
    "plugs into $ 1-\\cfrac{1}{k^2} \\approx 0.889$\n",
    "\n",
    "$ 200,000 \\cdot 0.889 = 177800 $\n"
